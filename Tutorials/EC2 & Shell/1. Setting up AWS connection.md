## set up connection to the server 
- On AWS create a new EC2 instance, t3.micro 
- A .pem file would be downloaded, save it in the same directory as the Dockerfile
- SSH into the EC2 instance - follow instructions on the aws SSH tab inside the connect option. it should be 2 commands:

```shell
chmod 400 example.pem 
ssh -i "example.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-60-196-157.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```
* After granting the necessary permissions, you should be able to connect to the server only with the second command:

```shell
ssh -i "example.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-60-196-157.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```
